------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my version of the atari-style joystick game Galaxian.  I completed this
project for an end of year project for AP Computer Science my Junior year of 
high school.  I can't say it is error or bug proof, but the graphics and gameplay
do immitate the original fairly well.
